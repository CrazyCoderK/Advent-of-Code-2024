Haven't coded in ages so trying to get back into it with the Advent of Code this year. Hopefully I make it further than the last couple of years! I'm uploading solutions in order to hold myself accountable so that I make my solutions actually readable and also not have the worst time complexity ever witnessed. Also I plan to do the solutions at times when I'm free meaning that they're not all going to be uploaded on the day of the challenge, but instead I may do 3-4 days worth in one go.
